1.	In your own words describe a process needed to transfer data from one DB server schema to another provided rows will extracted by date column and the insertion would be based on muticolumn primary key following update record if exist else insert.

          This process can be achieved by an ETL Concept ( Slowly Changing Dimension Type-1).
          In this case, both source and target are DB servers. We can implement this using by SQL.
          If there are different type of sources like Excel, text and DB Server, we can implement this using ETL tools like                 
          Informatica, Talent or Pentaho. 

        
Using SQL Server :
Stored Procedure and Cursor :

                    Three steps involved in this process are Extraction of Data, Transformation and Loading the Data.
First step includes extracting the data from Source DB Server with a where clause on Date to get the data with    current business date.
                  Getting into the logic we start with creating a stored procedure, create variables for all the columns and load data using cursor. Fetch data from source row by row into these SP variables and transform as per the requirements. After fetching the record we compare it with the existing DB server to check if the record already exists.

We start a if loop and specify the Composite primary key check, if exists it will go inside the loop and check if the incoming record is updated in any columns using the checksum concept. If something’s changed then we update the record, if nothing’s changed we go to fetch the next record.
In the else part, if the incoming record doesn’t exist, we simply write insert code and end the transaction.

This is SCD type -1, for SCD-2 we use flags to maintain the historical data.
